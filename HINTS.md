# Hints

The code in the `calculateTotalArea` and `calculateTotalArea` should not depend on the specific figures, i.e it should 
not check if a figure is a `Circle` or a `Square` or whatever.

Not looking for specific figures allow the `FigureManager` to be able to work with figures that are implemented in the
future.
